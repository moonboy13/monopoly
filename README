Files to create a monopoly clone.

First version will be a command line game.

The second should have a GUI
------------------------------------------
my_errs holds custom errors

main_nogui takes care of starting the game and moving the players around
the board

Mono_module is where most of the gameboard actions happen, defines classes for
the players and spaces. Has functions implemented for the income tax space,
most of the community chest cards and a function to deal with what happens when
a player is too poor to pay a debt.

Still cannont fully delete the reference to a player upon deletion even though
their information is wiped. Need to add logic for Chance cards, what happens
when a player lands on a space and the building of houses/hotels.
